_Sell
=====
This is a simple point-of-sale application created in something like 2012. Everything is configured in the code, it only
works on Windows and doesn't exactly have good UX. Welll

Don't use this I guess?

Building
========
Use either Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider, they should configure everything for you. No idea if there's proper
build tools for C# but this works I guess

Try not to use this in Production though, it's like uh quite bad
